||from_node_id, to_node_id, length_in_mile, number_of_lanes, speed_limit_in_mph, capacity_in_pcphpl, link_type_for_display||

||TAZ, centroid_node_id||

input_demand.csv

||from_TAZ, to_TAZ, number_of_vehicles, vehicle_type, starting_time_in_min, ending_time_in_min||


Remarks:
1) A centroid node can be shared by multiple zones. 
2) Connectors are allowed in the network representation. When calculating the shortest path from zone A to zone B, we include only outgoing connectors from zone A and incoming connectors to zone B in the network representation. When performing traffic simulation, we accept vehicle paths are a sequence of physical links (excluding the first connector link of zone A and the last connector link of zone B).
3) Default values for different link types.
