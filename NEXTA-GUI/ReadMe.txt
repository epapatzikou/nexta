0. Zoom in and zoom out button 
1. single feature selection from different layers: node, zone, path, vehicle
2. list feature information on left-hand side
3. pull all database for each layer.
4. save layer information to KML
5. import shapefile directly, schema 



3. add single node

how to 

1. Add node and vehicle list, link information editing
2. Provide timetabling statistics
3. Estimation and prediction view

Need detailed functional requirements from Jeff.
For transportation planning courses
1. define zones as centroids, use node number
2. OD demand matrix

Tao: traffic prediction engine (based on historical, flow volume), given incident data
	(Xuesong) Based on Newell's model, given different types of data, generate OD demand matrix
	 spatial reliability visualization
		 
    reliable routes, GPS map matching code (in the future)
