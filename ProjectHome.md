## Description ##

Network EXplorer for Traffic Analysis (NEXTA) (Version 3) is an open-source GUI that aims to facilitate the preparation, post-processing and analysis of transportation assignment, simulation and scheduling datasets.  NeXTA Version 3 uses [DTALite](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dtalite/), a fast dynamic traffic assignment engine, for transportation network analysis.

DTALite uses a computationally simple but theoretically rigorous traffic queuing model in its lightweight mesoscopic simulation engine. Its built-in parallel computing capability dramatically speeds-up the analysis process by using widely available multi-core CPU hardware. It takes about 1 hour to compute agent-based dynamic traffic equilibrium for a large-scale network with 1 million vehicles for 20 iterations.


NEXTA Version 2 has been widely used as the front-end GUI for DYNASMART and TRANSIMS. [NEXTA Version 2 for TRANSIMS](http://www.transims-opensource.net/)

## Motivation ##

NeXTA Version 3 aims to:

  * provide a clean open-source code base to enable transportation researchers and software developers to continue to build upon and expand its range of capabilities to other simulation/optimization packages.

  * make critical issues visible to researchers by visualizing time-varying traffic flow dynamics and traveler route choice behavior in an integrated 2D/3D environment.

  * provide a free education tool for students to understand the complex decision-making process in transportation planning and optimization processes. In this version, "e" in "NeXTA" is for Education.


## Educational Tools ##

Initial efforts have begun to develop a step-by-step tutorial and a self-study software package for students to learn advanced modeling skills in transportation planning applications. To teach the essential 4-step process (trip generation, trip distribution, modal split and traffic assignment) in transportation planning and introduce students to using NeXTA, a step-by-step tutorial will introduce students to building simplified transportation networks, and accompanying spreadsheets illustrate the complex computational details of the 4-step process. Using NeXTAâ€™s traffic simulation tools, the self-study guide will assist students in understanding important transportation planning principles in high-impact planning applications, such as how to assess impacts of earthquakes on metropolitan regions and how to systematically evaluate bridge retrofit scenarios.


## Features ##

NeXTA Version 3 now has the following capabilities:

### 1. Create, import, edit, store, export and visualize transportation network data. ###

![http://imageshack.us/a/img695/9897/3d2dwithbackgroundimage.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img695/9897/3d2dwithbackgroundimage.png)

The NEXTA now support importing the following data
1.	GIS shape files
2.	Synchro UTDF and combined CSV files
3.	TMC-based sensor data (e.g. Inrix or traffic.com)
4.	Import google transit feed data
5.	Open dynsmart data set for reliability analysis
6.	NGSim data for vehicle analysis
7.	RAS train timetable format


NEXTA also can export to the following format.
1.	Google Earth KML
2.	GIS shape file: node/link/zone, or convert user-defined CSV to shape
3.	synchro (UTDF)
4.	Use QEM tool to determine timing data
5.	Export to Visim ANM format
6.	Identify signal location, estimate signal timing based on QEM tool
7.	Subarea analysis to provide path flow pattern from Vissim simulation


> _The height (Z-axis) represents link-specific lane-volume, the color range of those vertical strips between red and green represents travel time variability (quantified as travel speed standard deviation at peak hours). Red: large variability, green: low variability. From this graph, it is easy to see that large volume does not necessarily lead to high travel time variability._


The DTALite package provides the following unique features using the AMS data hub format through NEXTA.

1.	Unlimited number of link types
2.	Unlimited number of demand types/demand files, 24 hour loading period: Flexible network conversion and linkage with GIS Shapefile (importing, script for mapping planning data to our data hub): save time, allow flexible number of link types and node types)
3.	Flexible demand data format: 3-column (o,d, value), multiple columns (o,d, SOV, HOV, Truck, subtotal), matrix, with 15-min departure time interval. Agent file
4.	Typical vehicle types: mapping from trip types to vehicle types, vehicle emission rates for different vehicle types, different ages
5.	Semi-continuous Value Of Time distribution
6.	Common types of sensor data, link count, lane count, at user-defined interval, speed data, density data, route travel time data,
7.	Unlimited number of safety prediction models, based on link volume, length, link type, # of intersections/drive ways per miles
8.	Movement-specific parameters (based on HCM/QEM methodology)
